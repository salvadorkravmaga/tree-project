GetFrom = ::ffff:185.243.113.108
PostTo = ::ffff:185.243.113.59
dApps = TREECHAT

This is an example of tree configuration file

Configuration applies to the whole node and the only option is:

TrustedNodes, which tells the node which nodes are free to post to ours without finding a proof-of-work. Seperate them with comma like:
TrustedNodes = trustednode1,trustednode2,...

For specific account there are three available options:

GetFrom, which tells the daemon from which node our account wants to ask for data about it, in this example ::ffff:185.243.113.108
PostTo, which tells the daemon to which node our account wants to post its data, in this example ::ffff:185.243.113.59
dApps, which tells the daemon from which applications our account accepts data, in this example this account accepts data from other accounts only through TREECHAT application
